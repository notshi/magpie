# The Magpie
The Magpie is Bradford's Radical News Sheet.

However, we always publish one in time for the Bradford Zine Fair.

The Magpie is an ‘occasional' publication - so not suitable for advertising immanent events.

There is usually a theme but contributions are always related to Bradford - with a humorous, radical or satirical edge. Please send contributions in a word document, text file or an email; so long as we can copy & paste!  
Articles can be stories, articles, poems, drawings, photos, sketches.  
Please supply who to credit (anon if you want).
